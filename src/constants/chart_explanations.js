`The distribution of normalized cost satisfaction (percentage of budget spent on approved projects) across the voters.
A voter satisfaction of 0% means none of the projects approved by the voter got selected.
100% satisfaction means that the whole budget was spent on approved projects.

For each satisfaction interval of 5% we plot the percentage of voters with that amount of satisfaction.
The average satisfaction is given as a vertical bar.`;
